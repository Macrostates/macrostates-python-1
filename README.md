# Python-1 specification package

This package describes one reusable convention set for Python code. It is
intended for projects that want these language-level expectations without
necessarily using the same repository layout, tooling, packaging, or test
structure.

## Macrostates

This package is part of [Macrostates](https://github.com/orgs/Macrostates), a
project for composing reusable specification packages into specs-driven
development projects.

## Summary

This package defines a reusable Python baseline: modern supported Python, clear
and maintainable code, practical type annotations at stable boundaries,
`pathlib` filesystem paths, timezone-aware UTC timestamps for real moments,
meaningful exception handling, standard Python logging, and testable I/O
boundaries.

Project-shaped Python repository conventions belong in a project package such
as `python-project-1`.

## Scope

- Python runtime posture.
- Code clarity and module responsibility.
- Type annotation expectations at stable boundaries.
- Filesystem path handling.
- Time and timestamp conventions.
- Error handling.
- Logging.
- I/O boundary testability.

Project layout, dependency management, formatting tools, linting tools, static
type checking tools, test layout, hooks, packaging, and Docker integration are
out of scope for this package.

## Macrostates artifacts

Follow the selected Meta package's project layout: numbered specification
packages and the project entrypoint are tracked under `.macrostates/specs/`.
Implementation documentation, decisions, workflows and release declarations,
when required by project rules, live under `.macrostates/implementation/`.
Application source, tests, build configuration and runtime configuration retain
their language/tool locations outside `.macrostates/`. This package does not
make the Macrostates CLI mandatory or change the scope of a subproject.
